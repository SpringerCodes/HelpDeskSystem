<h1>Final Project: Helpdesk Assistant</h1>
<p>This program was designed for CSCI315: Data Structures and Algorithms. The only requirement was to<br>
write a program that utilized two data structures. As such, we chose to write a simplified helpdesk support<br>
system that would be common to any office. Users can file a ticket, which implements a queue data structure, and then<br>
assign the tickets to technicians. Once they tickets are assigned, they move from the queue and into a linked list<br>
where they can be revised and have their statuses updated as necessary.</p>
